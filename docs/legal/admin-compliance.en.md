# Sub2API Plus Deployment and Operation Compliance Commitment

Version: v2026.08.15

This document applies to any individual, organization, or authorized representative that deploys, configures, manages, operates, or effectively controls a Sub2API Plus instance. Before continuing to access or use console functions, the acknowledging party must read, understand, and accept this document in full.

## 1. Scope

Sub2API Plus is open-source software. Any self-hosted deployment, modification, hosted operation, external service, commercial use, user management, content processing, data processing, payment settlement, customer support, or upstream account/API usage based on Sub2API Plus is the sole responsibility of the party that deploys, operates, or controls the relevant instance.

This document does not replace the open-source license, upstream terms of service, user agreements, privacy policies, data processing agreements, commercial contracts, regulatory filings, administrative permits, security assessments, or any other documents, procedures, or obligations required by applicable law or contract.

> **Technical preview and production warning:** the current `0.2.x` series is intended for functional validation and compatibility testing. It has not completed an independent security audit, sustained load testing, disaster-recovery exercises, cross-version database rollback validation, or production service-level qualification. It should not be deployed directly to production or used for critical workloads, real paid users, irreplaceable data, or high-value credentials. This statement describes release maturity and operational risk; it does not add a restriction to the rights granted by LGPL-3.0-or-later. Any operator choosing to proceed should first complete its own isolated review, load testing, backup restoration, fault injection, migration, and rollback acceptance.

## 2. Responsibility of the Deploying or Operating Party

The acknowledging party must independently assess and continuously comply with the laws, regulations, regulatory requirements, industry rules, contractual obligations, and platform policies that may apply in its location, server location, target-user location, place of actual business operation, and the locations of upstream service providers.

The acknowledging party must ensure that it has all authorizations, qualifications, filings, permits, assessments, contracts, risk-control capabilities, content-safety capabilities, data-protection capabilities, complaint-handling mechanisms, and emergency-response capabilities required for deploying and operating the relevant instance. Such obligations are not transferred, waived, or reduced by the use of open-source software.

## 3. No Affiliation and Allocation of Responsibility

Any third-party instance, commercial service, paid plan, user solicitation, content processing, data processing, account usage, API call, payment settlement, customer support, or promotional activity is independently carried out by the corresponding deploying, operating, or controlling party. The open-source nature of this project, code contributions, issue discussions, documentation maintenance, version releases, bug fixes, community communications, or general technical explanations do not create participation in, authorization of, approval of, warranty for, joint operation, agency, partnership, employment, authorized operation, joint control, revenue sharing, joint tort, or any other joint-and-several liability relationship between the open-source project, copyright holders, contributors, or maintainers and such activities.

The acknowledging party must not use the project name, marks, documentation, screenshots, community content, or open-source repository information to state or imply that its third-party instance, commercial service, paid plan, or operation is participated in, authorized, approved, warranted, or endorsed by the open-source project, copyright holders, contributors, maintainers, or community.

The acknowledging party is independently responsible for consequences arising from its deployment, configuration, operation, promotion, charging, user-behavior management, content processing, data processing, account usage, API calls, or violations of laws, regulations, regulatory requirements, contractual obligations, or upstream rules.

Any mandatory liability that cannot be excluded or limited by agreement shall be handled according to applicable law. Such statutory exception does not constitute participation in, authorization of, approval of, warranty for, or endorsement of any third-party deployment, operation, or commercial activity.

## 4. Compliance Commitments

By continuing to use console functions, the acknowledging party makes the following commitments:

1. It has independently reviewed and will continuously comply with the terms of service, acceptable use policies, supported countries and regions, account/API key rules, commercial-use requirements, resale restrictions, risk-control requirements, and technical restrictions of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and any other upstream service providers.
2. It will not use this project to bypass, or assist others in bypassing, upstream regional restrictions, access restrictions, account restrictions, risk controls, billing restrictions, identity verification, usage limits, or terms of service.
3. It will not provide API relay, model-call resale, account quota distribution, shared subscriptions, paid calls, top-up/payment agency, or similar services to the public or an indefinite group of users unless all necessary authorizations, qualifications, filings, permits, assessments, or contractual arrangements have been obtained.
4. If it provides generative AI services, deep synthesis services, algorithm-related services, API relay, paid calls, or other potentially regulated services within Mainland China or to the Mainland China public, it will independently complete all potentially applicable obligations regarding internet information services, generative AI services, deep synthesis, algorithm filing, security assessment, cybersecurity, data security, personal information protection, content safety, payment settlement, taxes, and upstream authorization.
5. It will maintain user management, access control, content review, abuse handling, log retention, privacy protection, data deletion, complaint handling, emergency takedown, and security incident response mechanisms appropriate to the scale and risk of its business.
6. It will not make any statement, commitment, marketing representation, or warranty to any user, customer, partner, channel, regulator, or third party that conflicts with Section 3 of this document.
7. It will be independently responsible for consequences arising from its deployment, operation, promotion, charging, user-behavior management, content processing, data processing, account usage, API calls, or violations of laws, regulations, regulatory requirements, contractual obligations, or upstream rules.

## 5. Risk and Responsibility Notice

Using Sub2API Plus for public API services, commercial relay, quota distribution, team sharing, paid calls, or similar purposes may involve risks relating to terms of service, contractual breach, data protection, content safety, consumer protection, payment settlement, taxes, export controls, sanctions compliance, cybersecurity, industry access, and administrative regulation. Requirements vary by jurisdiction and business model and may change over time.

The mandatory notice, document link, exact-phrase acknowledgment, and local acknowledgment record in the console are intended to provide clear, conspicuous, and reproducible notice of deployment and operation risks, confirm that the console user has read the current version of this document, and create a clear responsibility-separation record between the open-source project, copyright holders, contributors, maintainers and any third-party deploying, operating, or controlling party.

### 5.1 Software maturity and availability

The project is provided as-is under its open-source license. It does not promise uninterrupted availability, absence of defects, suitability for a particular purpose, production certification, security certification, regulatory approval, commercial availability, or a maintenance period. Passing tests and CI does not eliminate failures caused by real networks, upstream policy changes, unusual responses, streaming connections, concurrency spikes, clock drift, database contention, or unstable proxies. A version number, `latest` image, GitHub Release, or “release build” identifies a distribution channel only. Operators should pin versions and image digests, review each changelog, and avoid automated rolling-tag upgrades without verified backups.

### 5.2 Credentials, proxies, and accounts

The system may process API keys, OAuth and refresh tokens, cookies, proxy credentials, account identifiers, quota snapshots, and request metadata. Logging, reverse proxies, browser extensions, monitoring systems, backups, screenshots, or exports may expose that material. Operators are responsible for key management, least privilege, encryption, audit logging, redaction, rotation, retention, and deletion. Fixed-proxy routing reduces accidental egress drift but does not guarantee proxy trustworthiness, exclusivity, location, anonymity, uptime, or non-retention. Operators must independently verify that model requests, quota probes, health checks, OAuth refreshes, and WebSocket traffic use the intended egress.

### 5.3 Upstream, quota, and billing information

Upstream providers and relay services may change APIs, fields, status codes, controls, model names, pricing, regional policies, and terms without notice. Compatibility code is based on finite samples and may omit, synthesize, reorder, or transform fields. Stream retries can duplicate requests or charges. Quota values from `/backend-api/wham/usage`, `credits.balance`, reset counters, and usage windows are point-in-time upstream snapshots and may be stale or incomplete. The displayed USD amount is only `Credit / 25`; it is not legal tender, an invoice, a settlement record, a promised price, or a withdrawable asset. The two-429 rule, “429 Guard” history injection, local threshold handling, and scheduler do not change upstream limits or guarantee success.

### 5.4 Data, concurrency, and recovery

Bulk inventory, bulk edit, import, and scheduling operations can affect many accounts at once. Concurrent execution, stale pages, repeated submission, partial transactions, and incompatible versions can produce partial success or temporary inconsistency. Back up PostgreSQL, required Redis state, configuration, encryption keys, proxy settings, and matching source versions before changes, then test restoration in an isolated environment. Database migrations are not promised to be reversible. The scheduler is not a financial limit, capacity guarantee, strict fair queue, or independent oversell control; critical deployments require external budget, rate, concurrency, and circuit-breaker controls.

### 5.5 Security, privacy, content, and support

Examples and defaults are demonstrations, not hardened configuration. Replace secrets, isolate databases and Redis, configure HTTPS and trusted proxies, require strong administrator authentication, and maintain firewalls, rate limits, monitoring, and updates. Inputs, outputs, attachments, tool calls, and logs may contain personal data, confidential material, protected works, or inaccurate model content. Operators must establish a lawful basis, notice, minimization, access, deletion, moderation, and human review appropriate to their use. Model output should not be the sole unsupervised basis for high-impact medical, legal, financial, safety, or control decisions.

Maintainers do not promise response times, repair times, long-term support, data recovery, operational assistance, or permanent compatibility with a particular upstream. Public reports must not contain live secrets, account exports, production databases, proxy credentials, or identifiable logs. Operators need their own monitoring, on-call process, change approval, rollback, capacity planning, and shutdown procedure. This risk list is not exhaustive and is not legal, tax, financial, security, or compliance advice. The license's warranty and liability terms continue to apply; these operational notices do not modify LGPL-3.0-or-later rights or obligations.

## 6. Electronic Acknowledgment
